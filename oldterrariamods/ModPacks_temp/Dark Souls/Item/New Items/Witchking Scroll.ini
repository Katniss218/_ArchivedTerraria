toolTip=To close the portal to the Abyss you must seek out the Witchking and restore the strange ring he drops.
toolTip2=He will appear out of the Abyss at night, and more often deeper underground, especially in dungeons. 
toolTip3=The most assured way to find him, however, is to enter the Abyss yourself, using the Covanent of Artorias ring.
