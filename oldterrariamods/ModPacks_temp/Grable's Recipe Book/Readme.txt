Recipe Book - with Filtering and and History. 


***(This version of the mod has been edited by Tim Hjersted to only use the F3 quick key, no cheat version, for use with the Dark Souls mod. To download the original by Grable see the links below.)***


Description:
	Lists all available Recipes created by the game and loaded Mods.
	Filtering is done through Item Types, Mods and Required Item.

	To open the Recipe Book click the little book icon nex to the hotbar or the new slot in the inventory.
	Pressing F5 (depending on the override) opens the Recipe Book as well.
	 


No Cheat Override is always on with this version of the mod (a Dark Souls edit):
	Disables spawing of items, unless the player has the required items in their inventory.
	Allso allows only crafting of recipes, not any item.
	
Items:
	Recipe Book:
		Novelty item, it acts like normal books in addition to that when clicked 
		in the world it toggles the Recipe Book.

!!	This mod is "Mod Settings" compatible.
